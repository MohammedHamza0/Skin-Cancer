# Skin-Cancer

"Delighted to present my latest project centered around leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesion images! Through extensive training, my model demonstrates exceptional proficiency in discerning between various types of skin cancer.

The robust model achieves [87.33%]% accuracy in accurately classifying different types of skin lesions, offering promising advancements in dermatology diagnostics. From meticulously preprocessing the dataset to fine-tuning hyperparameters, this journey has been a rewarding exploration of cutting-edge technology and its potential impact on healthcare.

Eager to engage in discussions, share insights, and explore the vast array of possibilities this technology brings to the realm of dermatologicalÂ diagnoses!"
